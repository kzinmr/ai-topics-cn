# Blog Author Thought Analysis

Extract and document blog authors' recent philosophical positions, technical stances, and thought evolution with proper citations for the AI topics wiki.

## When to Use
- User requests "analyze author's recent thoughts" or "what's their philosophy?"
- Creating wiki pages that need more than basic bio + recent titles
- Tracking ideological shifts in thought leaders over time
- Building citation-rich analysis pages for the wiki

## Pipeline Overview

```
OPML/Blog List → Check blog_authors.json → RSS Fetch → Article Scraping → Thought Extraction → Wiki Creation → RSS Monitoring
```

## Step 0: Check Pre-Scraped Data First

**Always check `~/scripts/blog_authors.json` before re-scraping.**
The `build_blog_wiki.py` script already scraped all OPML blogs and cached:
- Author name, bio, blog URL, RSS URL
- About page content
- Recent post titles/topics

```python
import json
with open('~/scripts/blog_authors.json') as f:
    authors = json.load(f)
# Search by blog URL or author name
```

If the cached data is sufficient, skip to Step 4 (thought analysis). Only re-scrape if:
- The cached bio is too short or generic
- You need recent article content (not just titles)
- The author has new posts since the last scrape

## Step 1: RSS Feed Discovery & Parsing

**Namespace Handling** (critical pitfall):
- **Atom feeds**: Strip `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"` before parsing with `ElementTree`
- **RSS 2.0 feeds**: Handle `atom:` namespace prefixes in RSS feeds
- **Regex cleanup**: `re.sub(r'\sxmlns[^"]*"[^"]*"', '', xml_text)` before `ET.fromstring()`

```python
# Atom parsing example
xml_clean = re.sub(r'\sxmlns[^"]*"[^"]*"', '', xml_text)
root = ET.fromstring(xml_clean)
for entry in root.findall('.//entry'):
    title = entry.findtext('title', '').strip()
    link = entry.find('link').get('href', '')
```

## Step 2: Article Selection for Thought Analysis

**Prioritize articles that reveal philosophy/positions:**
- Opinion pieces, essays, "hot takes"
- Technical deep-dives with strong positions
- Responses to industry events
- Avoid: Release notes, tool updates, simple link blogs

**Selection criteria:**
- Recent (last 3-6 months)
- Substantive content (500+ words)
- Clear authorial voice/position

## Step 3: Deep Article Scraping

Use `web_extract` for full article content:
```python
from hermes_tools import web_extract
results = web_extract(urls=[article_url1, article_url2, ...])
```

**What to extract:**
- Key quotes and positions (with exact wording)
- Technical arguments and reasoning chains
- Evolution from previous positions
- References to other thinkers/tools
- Contradictions or nuanced stances

## Step 4: Thought Analysis & Wiki Page Creation

**Structure for thought analysis pages:**

```markdown
---
title: "Author Name"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [person, blogger, thought-analysis, ai]
aliases: ["blog-url-slug"]
---

# Author Name

| | |
|---|---|
| **Blog** | [url](url) |
| **RSS** | feed_url |
| **Social** | handles |

## Core Philosophy

### 1. [Major Position Theme]
> Direct quote with attribution
> Another key quote

Context and analysis...

### 2. [Second Major Theme]
...

## Recent Thought Evolution (YYYY)
- How positions have changed
- Key inflection points
- Emerging themes

## Key Quotes
> "Quote 1" - [Source](url)
> "Quote 2" - [Source](url)

## Related Concepts
- [[concept-1]]
- [[concept-2]]

## Sources
- [Article Title](url)
- [Another Article](url)
```

**Citation requirements:**
- Every claim needs a source URL
- Direct quotes must be verbatim with attribution
- Distinguish between author's words and your analysis

## Step 4b: Upgrading Existing Entity Pages (from build_blog_wiki.py)

`build_blog_wiki.py` generates initial entity pages for all OPML blogs, but these often contain only a Bio paste and recent titles. **Upgrade rather than recreate:**

```python
from hermes_tools import patch, read_file

# 1. Check if entity page already exists
existing = search_files(pattern=f"*{author_slug}*.md", target="files", path="~/wiki/entities/")

# 2. Read current page to preserve existing metadata
current = read_file(f"~/wiki/entities/{author_slug}.md")

# 3. Use patch to ADD thought analysis sections (don't overwrite)
patch(path=f"~/wiki/entities/{author_slug}.md",
      old_string="## Recent Posts (topics/interests)\n\n- (no recent posts found)",
      new_string="<thought analysis content>")

# 4. Update tags in frontmatter
patch(path=f"~/wiki/entities/{author_slug}.md",
      old_string="tags: [person, blogger, hn-popular]",
      new_string="tags: [person, blogger, hn-popular, thought-analysis, ai]")
```

**Upgrade priority order:**
1. Authors with known AI/tech opinions (Simon Willison, Mitchell Hashimoto, etc.)
2. Authors with substantial recent essays (not just link blogs)
3. Authors whose work directly impacts AI ecosystem

## Step 5: RSS Monitoring Setup

After creating thought analysis page:
1. Add feed to blogwatcher: `blogwatcher-cli add "Author Name" blog_url --feed-url rss_url`
2. Set up periodic scanning for new thought evolution
3. Link monitoring to wiki update workflow

## Pitfalls & Gotchas

### RSS Namespace Issues
- **Atom**: `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"` breaks `ET.fromstring()` without stripping
- **RSS with Atom extensions**: Mixed namespaces require careful handling
- **Solution**: Strip all xmlns declarations before parsing

### Feed Parsing Failures
- Some feeds return empty entries due to malformed XML
- Always verify `len(entries) > 0` before proceeding
- Fallback to HTML scraping if RSS fails

### Quote Extraction Quality
- Don't paraphrase - use exact quotes for citations
- Verify quotes against original text
- Include enough context to understand the position

### Wiki Page Conflicts
- Check if entity page exists before creating new one
- If exists, **upgrade** with thought analysis rather than duplicate
- Use `patch` tool to add sections to existing pages
- **Duplicate aliases**: Some authors may have multiple entity files (e.g., `simonw.md` AND `simon-willison.md`). Use the most complete one and consider merging

### Network/Scraping Issues
- `curl` on RSS feeds may return empty due to Cloudflare or rate limiting
- If RSS fetch fails, try `web_extract` with the blog's HTML URL instead
- Some blogs (Substack, Medium) require special handling for RSS vs HTML content

## Example Workflow

```python
# 1. Fetch RSS
rss_urls = extract_from_opml("blogs.opml")

# 2. Select substantive articles
priority_urls = [u for u in rss_urls if is_essay(u)]

# 3. Scrape full content
articles = web_extract(urls=priority_urls[:5])

# 4. Extract quotes and positions
thoughts = analyze_thoughts(articles)

# 5. Create wiki page
create_wiki_page(author, thoughts)

# 6. Set up monitoring
blogwatcher_add(author, rss_url)
```
